continuous monitoring

-why
to make infrasctucture proactive
manual monitoring/traditional monitoring means that the monitoring is reactive, means that the fault is fixed after a problem occurs
in continuous monitoring the minor problems that could affect the pipeline is known/alerted and handled
infrascture is optimised
cost is reduced
to get insights
to optimise resources
to make app secure and conclave

monitoring is to monitor infrastructure

-check manual monitoring vs tarditional monitoring

-continuous monitoring phases
define

implement
analyze
