aws region -geo loc where aws has setup their infra
aws has 33 regions
 
hierarchy of region
region>availability zone>data centres(max 3)

regions are isolated i.e not replicated, causes fault toleration, resilience, redundancy

multiAZ the availabilty zone sould have multiple copies across multiple AZ, so data is not lost when calamities take place

a user can specify a region or AZ for the data not the data centre

region constraints:
governance
proximity
service availability
price

odm - original device mfg-er
networking devices from multiple odms are procured to limit hacking of specific data

point of presence:
cdn- content delivary n/w
from origin server origin data is pushed across multiple loc or edge location using cdn, so streaming is fast
we are being diverted to the nearest data centre where this data is cached
cloudfront uses this to distribute across the world
route53 uses to send the nearest edge loc ---it is a dns
service to check whether this edge loc are heatlthy or not, point of presence is used here
aws has setup PoP around 70 across the globe
less freq accessed data is moved to regional edge cache
the freq accessed data is moved to edge loc

aws infrastructure features:
elasticity & scalability
fault tolerance
high availability
